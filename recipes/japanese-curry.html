        <h3>Quick and easy dish, most prevalent in Korean and Japanese culture</h3>
        <p>I mealprep mass quantities of this, because I'm too lazy to make it on a regular basis. I could eat this everyday for weeks</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Your meat of choice (chicken, beef)</li>
            <li>Curry roux (Vermont Curry, Golden Curry)</li>
            <li>Vegetables (chopped into small, bite-sized pieces:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Carrot</li>
                <li>Potato</li>
            </ul>
            <li>550ml of water</li>
            <li>A dash of vegetable oil (or avocado oil)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir-fry meat and veggies in the vegetable (or avocado) oil in a dutch oven (or other large pot) for 5-7 minutes</li>
            <li>Add water and bring to a boil. Bring down the heat and let ingredients simmer until they are tender (~15 minutes)</li>
            <li>Break up the curry roux into chunks/pieces, and stir in over the simmering heat until completely cooked</li>
            <li>Serve over hot rice</li>
        </ol>
