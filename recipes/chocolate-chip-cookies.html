        <h4>Nothing better than homemade chocolate chip cookies!</h4>
        <p>From what little I know about baking, it's important to carefully follow the directions; one deviation could have a very drastic impact on the results!</p>
        <p>I personally don't like my cookies to be super sweet, so I dial back on the amount of sugar added. This way, I don't feel as guilty when devouring an ungodly number of cookies in one sitting <img src="../images/mochi.png"></p>
        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup of butter (salted or unsalted, room temperature)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white (granulated) sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all purpose flour (unbleached)</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 (half) tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt (or can use sea salt if you like chunky salt)</li>
            <li>2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate morsels (or chopped up chocolate)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper, or aluminum foil (non-stick spray optional)</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix together the dry ingredients (minus the sugar):</li>
            <ul>
                <li>baking powder</li>
                <li>baking soda></li>
                <li>salt</li>
                <li>flour (when measuring out, <strong><em>DO NOT PACK OR STUFF DOWN INTO THE MEASURING CUP</em></strong></li>
            </ul>
            <li>In another bowl, beat together the butter, white sugar, brown sugar and vanilla extract until creamy</li>
            <li>Mix in the eggs one at a time, making sure the egg is properly mixed in after each addition</li>
            <li>Mix in the dry ingredients (the flour mixture) in increments until the cookie dough is homogenous</li>
            <li>Evenly mix in chocolate chip morsels</li>
            <li>Roll 2-3 tbsps of cookie dough (or however big/small you want them to be) into small spheres before placing onto prepared baking sheets</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 8-10 minutes. Take out when they are just barely starting to turn golden brown</li>
            <li>Let sit on baking sheet for 2 minutes before moving them to a cooling rack</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
