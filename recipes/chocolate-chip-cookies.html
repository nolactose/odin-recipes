        <h4>Nothing better than homemade chocolate chip cookies!</h4>
        <p>From what little I know about baking, it's important to carefully follow the directions; one deviation could have a very drastic impact on the results!</p>
        <p>I personally don't like my cookies to be super sweet, so I dial back on the amount of sugar added. This way, I don't feel as guilty when devouring an ungodly number of cookies in one sitting <img src="../images/mochi.png"></p>
        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>3/4 cup of salted butter (room temperature)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white (granulated) sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups all purpose flour (unbleached)</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 (half) tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt (or can use sea salt if you like chunky salt)</li>
            <li>2 cups of semi-sweet chocolate morsels (or chopped up chocolate)</li>
        </ul>
